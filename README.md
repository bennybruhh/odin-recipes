Currently working on a website about recipes. The skills that I will try to demonstrate once I completed this website is:
    <ul>
    <li> Known the basics of HTML like:</li>
            <li>HTML boilerplate</li>
            <li>correct use of elements and attributes</li>
            <li>correct use of img, a, h1, etc.</li>
            <li>Link different pages into the main index file</li>
            <li>Correct use of Git and its function</li>
            <li>Using the ul and ol</li>
            <li>correct use of terminal</li>
    </ul>
I will input here the lessons that I realize while I'm making my way on building this website:
